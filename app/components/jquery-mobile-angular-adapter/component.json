  "readme": "JQuery Mobile Angular Adapter\n=====================\n\nDescription\n-------------\n\nIntegration between jquery mobile and angular.js. Needed as jquery mobile\nenhances the pages with new elements and styles and so does angular. With this adapter,\nall widgets in jquery mobile can be used directly in angular, without further modifications.\nFurthermore, this adapter also provides special utilities useful for mobile applications.\n\nIf you are interested in how to build mobile web apps with this adapter, have a look at the german book\n[Mobile Web-Apps mit JavaScript](http://www.opitz-consulting.com/go_javascriptbuch).\n\n\nDependencies\n----------------\n- angular 1.0.3\n- jquery 1.7.1\n- jquery mobile 1.2.0 Final\n\nExamples\n------------\n- See the [wiki page](wiki/Projects-using-the-adapter)\n- [Todo mobile](http://jsfiddle.net/tigbro/Du2DY/): JsFiddle\n- [Todo mobile](https://github.com/tigbro/todo-mobile): Single source app for jquery-mobile and sencha touch:\n- [Rent Your Legacy Car](https://github.com/mjswa/rylc-html5): A more complex example from the german book [Mobile Web-Apps mit JavaScript](http://www.opitz-consulting.com/go_javascriptbuch).\n\n\nReporting Issues\n-------------\n- Issues can be reported at the Github project.\n- Please provide a jsfiddle, using [this template](http://jsfiddle.net/tigbro/ZHKBA/).\n\n\nUsage\n---------\nNote: The directive `ng-app` for the html element is required, as in all angular applications.\n\n\n### Plain ###\n\nInclude this adapter _after_ angular and jquery mobile (see below).\n\n    <html ng-app>\n    <head>\n        <title>MobileToys</title>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"lib/jquery.mobile.css\"/>\n        <script src=\"lib/jquery.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"lib/jquery.mobile.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"lib/angular.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"lib/jquery-mobile-angular-adapter.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n\n### With requirejs 2.x ###\n\nCreate a `index.xhtml` file like the one below:\n\n    <html ng-app>\n    <head>\n        <title>MobileToys</title>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"lib/jquery.mobile.css\"/>\n        <script src=\"lib/requirejs.js\" data-main=\"main.js\"/>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n       ... your jqm pages ...\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\nAnd a `main.js` file with the following content:\n\n    require.config({\n      shim:{\n        'angular':{ deps:['jquery'], exports:'angular'}\n      }\n    });\n    function tryHoldReady() {\n      if (!tryHoldReady.executed && window.jQuery) {\n        window.jQuery.holdReady(true);\n        tryHoldReady.executed = true;\n      }\n    }\n    tryHoldReady();\n    require.onResourceLoad = tryHoldReady;\n    require([\n      \"jquery\",\n      \"jquery-mobile-angular-adapter\",\n      ... // your controllers, angular modules, ...\n    ], function (jquery) {\n      jquery.holdReady(false);\n    });\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- This assumes that all libs are in the root folder of your webapp. To put them into a subfolder like `lib` use the\n  paths argument in the call to `require.config` (e.g. `paths: {angular: lib/angular}`, ...)\n- The libraries jQuery, jQuery Mobile and the adapter are already AMD modules. Only angular is not, which is why\n  we need a shim config for it.\n- We simulate a later `load` event of the document by using `jQuery.holdReady`, by which we wait until all modules\n  have been loaded. This is needed as the normal `load` event may occur before all modules have been loaded by requirejs.\n  Note that this functionality was already included in requirejs 1.x, but no more in requirejs 2.x.\n- Usage of manual bootstrap of angular does not work well with jquery-mobile, as jquery-mobile relies on the\n  jQuery ready event to be fired at the right time.\n\nDirectory layout\n-------------------\nThis project follows the usual maven directory layout:\n\n- src/main/webapp: The production code\n- src/test/webapp: The test code\n- compiled: The result of the javascript compilation\n- compiled/min: Contains the minified files.\n\n\nBuild\n--------------------------\nThe build is done using maven and node js.\n\n- `mvn clean package`: This will create a new version of the adapter and put it into `/compiled`.\n- `mvn clean package -Ptest -Dbrowser=<path to your browser>`: As above, but will also execute the unit and ui tests.\n\nResults of the build:\n\n- `compiled/jquery-mobile-angular-adapter-<version>.js`: The adapter in one file, without dependencies.\n- `compiled/jquery-mobile-angular-adapter-standalone-<version>.js`: The adapter in one file including jquery, jquery-mobile and angular.\n   If you want to do something during the initialization of jquery-mobile, use the following callback:\n  `window.mobileinit = function() { ... }`\n\nRunning the tests\n-------------------\n\n- `mvn clean integration-test -Ptest`: This will do a build and execute the tests using js-test-driver.\n  The browser that is used can be specified in the pom.xml.\n- `mvn clean package jetty:run`: This will start a webserver under `localhost:8080/jqmng`.\n  The unit-tests can be run via the url `localhost:8080/jqmng/UnitSpecRunner.html`\n  The ui-tests can be run via the url `localhost:8080/jqmng/UiSpecRunner.html`\n\n\nNavigation and routes\n---------------------\n\nThe adapter integrates angular routes with jquery mobile in the following way:\n\n- If no route is defined, the default jquery mobile url handling applies:\n    * Navigation to a hash shows the page whose id is the same as the hash, e.g.\n    `<a href=\"#somePage\">`.\n    * Navigation to a normal page loads that page using ajax and\n    then navigates to that page, e.g. `<a href=\"somePage.html\">`\n- You can set the special property `jqmOptions` on routes, e.g.\n\n        $routeProvider.when('/somePage', {\n            templateUrl:'someTemplate.html',\n            jqmOptions: { transition: 'flip' }\n        });\n\n    Those properties are directly passed to `$.mobile.changePage`. For a documentation of the available options\n    have a look at the jquery mobile documentation.\n- You can set the special property `onActivate` in routes. If this is set,\n  it will be evaluated in the scope of the page to which the route navigates to,\n  before the `pagebeforeshow` event.\n\n  This expression can also use the properties from `$route.current.locals`, which are calculates by the `resolve` entry\n  of the route. E.g.\n\n        $routeProvider.when('/somePage', {\n            templateUrl:'someTemplate.html',\n            onActivate: 'someFn(someParam)',\n            resolve: {someParam: function() { return 'hello'; }}\n        });\n\n        function SomePageController($scope) {\n           $scope.someFn = function(someParam) {\n              expect(someParam).toBe('hello');\n           }\n        }\n\n- Please also look at the extensions to the `$location` service for controlling history and changing route params for just one route call.\n\nDefault routing: `basePath+$location.url()`\n\n* E.g. for a page `/somePath/somePage.html` and `location.url()=='/page1'` this results in `/somePath/page1`.\n* To be compatible to plain jquery mobile the adapter creates a default routing for all urls that are not\n  mapped by other routes.\n* If a document contains the link `<a href=\"somePage\">` and the user clicks on that link, angular updates `$location.url`\n  to `/somePage`. However, in plain jquery mobile, this should load the page `/somePath/somePage`. This is why\n  we append the `basePath` to the `$location.url()`.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- Internally, we use jquery mobile to load the pages and do the transition between the pages.\n  By this, we automatically support the prefetching and caching functionality for pages from jquery mobile (see their docs for details).\n  E.g. use `<a href=\"prefetchThisPage.html\" data-prefetch> ... </a>` in a parent page to prefetch a child page.\n- We always enable `$locationProvider.html5Mode` and set `$locationProvider.hashPrefix('!')`.\n  By this, we are compatible to the default jquery mobile behaviour,\n  e.g. links like `<a href=\"somePage.html\">` are possible and do not reload the whole page but use AJAX.\n- If you want to start an app directly on a subpage, use the following url:\n  * For an external page that should be loaded using ajax: `index.html#!/somePage.html`\n  * For an internal page that is also contained in the `index.html: `index.html#/!index.html#someOtherPage` (yes, this url contains\n    2 hashes). If you are sure that all browsers that you use support the new history API, you can also use the url\n    `index.html#someOtherPage` to start at an internal page.\n- jQuery mobile automatically creates a `<base>` tag for the main page and sets it's href-attribute to the main page.\n  There are some parts of angular that use this fact, so keep it in mind when debugging errors.\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\n- controllers on routes are not supported. Please use `ng-controller` within the page to be loaded for this\n  or the `onActivate` function on routes.\n  The reasoning behind this is that some pages of jquery mobile are local pages in the same document as the main page\n  and others are loaded using ajax. However, the pages in the same document are compiled at the same time the main page is compiled.\n  Furthermore, by supporting the page cache of jquery mobile assigning a controller would also not be possible.\n  To pass data via routes just let your controllers examine the current route using the `$route` and `$routeParams` service.\n- Routes with a `templateUrl` must point to a full jquery mobile page. Loading parts of jquery mobile pages is not supported.\n- The `ngView` directive cannot be used as jqm pages need to be inserted at a special place in the DOM.\n  However, the adapter takes care of the normal `ngView` handling and inserts the pages at the right place.\n- There needs to be an initial page in the main document of the application. I.e. a `<div data-role=\"page\">` within\n  that html file that also includes angular and jqm. All other pages can then be included using routes with\n  a `templateUrl` property.\n\n\nScopes\n-----------\nEvery page of jquery mobile gets a separate scope. The `$digest` of the global scope only evaluates the currently active page,\nso there is no performance interaction between pages.\n\nFor communicating between the pages use the `ngm-shared-controller` directive (see below).\n\nDirectives, Filters and Services\n-----------\n\n### Directive `ngm-shared-controller`\n\nSyntax: `<div ngm-shared-controller=\"name1:Controller1,name2:Controller2, ...\">`\n\nMobile pages are small, so often a usecase is split up into multiple pages.\nTo share common behaviour and state between those pages, this directive allows shared controllers.\n\nThe directive will create an own scope for every given controllers and store it\nin the variables as `name1`, `name2`, ....\nIf the controller is used on more than one page, the instance of the controller is shared.\n\nNote that the shared controller have the full scope functionality, e.g. for dependecy injection\nor using `$watch`.\n\n### Event-Directives of jQuery Mobile\n\nThe following event directives are supported (see [http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html)):\n\n- `ngm-tap`,`taphold`,\n- `ngm-swipe`,`ngm-swiperight`,`ngm-swipeleft`,\n- `ngm-vmouseover`,`ngm-vmouseout`,`ngm-vmousedown`,`ngm-vmousemove`,`ngm-vmouseup`,`ngm-vclick`,`ngm-vmousecancel`,\n- `ngm-orientationchange`,\n- `ngm-scrollstart`,`ngm-scrollend`,\n- `ngm-pagebeforeshow`,`ngm-pagebeforehide`,`ngm-pageshow`,`ngm-pagehide`\n\n\nUsage: E.g. `<a href=\"#\" ngm-swipeleft=\"myFn()\">`\n\n\n### Directive ngm-if\nThe directive `@ngm-if` allows to add/remove an element to/from the dom, depending on an expression.\nThis is especially useful at places where we cannot insert an `ng-switch` into the dom. E.g. jquery mobile\ndoes not allow elements between an `ul` and an `li` element.\n\nUsage: E.g. `<div ngm-if=\"myFlag\">asdfasdf</div>`\n\n### Service `$history`\n\nNote: This service is for internal purposes only (same level as `$browser`). Please use `$location.backMode()` or `$location.goBack()` instead.\n\nMethods and Properties:\n\n* `$history.go(relativeIndex)`: This will directly call `window.history.go(relativeIndex)`.\n* `$history.urlStack`: This contains the list of visited urls\n* `$history.activeIndex`: This defines the currently active index in the `urlStack`\n\n\n### Service `$location` (extensions)\n\n- `$location.routeOverride(someOverride)`: By this, you can override route properties only\n  for the next routing. This is useful e.g. for passing special parameters to the `onActivate` expression. The following\n  properties of routes can be overridden:\n\n     * `jqmOptions`: Options to give to `$.mobile.changePage` of jquery mobile (e.g. `transition`, ...)\n     * `locals`: the resolved functions from the `resolve` hash in a route.\n     * `onActivate`: the expression to evaluate on the target page with the `locals`.\n\n     E.g.\n\n        $location.routeOverride({\n          locals: {someKey: 'someValue'},\n          jqmOptions: {transition: 'pop'}\n        });\n        $location.path('/someRoutePath');\n\n        function SomePageController($scope) {\n           $scope.someActivateFn = function(someKey) {\n              expect(someKey).toBe(someValue);\n           }\n        }\n\n- `$location.backMode()`: This will try to go back in history to the url specified by `$location`. E.g. if the navigation path\n  to the current page is `page1->page2->page3` and we then call `$location.path('page1'); $location.backMode()` this will\n  go two steps back in history.\n  Note that this is in analogy to the already existing angular method `$location.replace`.\n- `location.goBack()`: This will go one step back in history: call `$location.backMode()` and fill the url of `$location` by the last\n  entry in the browser history.\n\n\n### Service $waitDialog\nThe service `$waitDialog` allows the access to the jquery mobile wait dialog. It provides the following functions:\n- `show(msg, callback)`: Opens the wait dialog and shows the given message (if existing).\n    If the user clicks on the wait dialog the given callback is called.\n    This can be called even if the dialog is currently showing. It will the change the message\n    and revert back to the last message when the hide function is called.\n- `hide()`: Restores the dialog state before the show function was called.\n- `waitFor(promise, msg)`: Shows the dialog as long as the given promise runs. Shows the given message if defined.\n- `waitForWithCancel(promise, cancelData, msg)`: Same as above, but rejects the promise with the given cancelData\n   when the user clicks on the wait dialog.\n\nDefault messages are:\n- `$.mobile.loader.prototype.options.textWithCancel`: for waitForWithCancel. This is a new property.\n- `$.mobile.loader.prototype.options.text`: for all other cases, see the jquery mobile docs.\n\n\n### Filter `paged`: Paging for lists\nLists can be paged in the sense that more entries can be additionally loaded. By \"loading\" we mean the\ndisplay of a sublist of a list that is already fully loaded in JavaScript. This is useful, as the main performance\nproblems result from DOM operations, which can be reduced with this paging mechanism.\n\nTo implement this paging mechanism, the angular filter `paged` was created.\nFor displaying a page within a list, simply use:\n\n    list | paged:'pagerId':12\n\nThis returns the subarray of the given array with the currently loaded pages.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. The first parameter is required and must be unique for every usage of the `paged` filter. It is the property name in the scope\nwhich stores the state of pagination for this filter usage, and also contains the function `loadMore` and `hasMore` (see below).\n2. If the second parameter is a number, it is interpreted as the pageSize. If this parameter is omitted, the default page size is used.\nThis is by default 10, and can be configured using\n\n    module([\"ng\"]).value('defaultListPageSize', 123);\n\nFor filtering and sorting the paged array, you can use filter chaining with the angular filters `filter` and `orderBy`, e.g.\n\n    list | filter:{name:'someName'} | orderBy:'name' | paged:'pagerId'\n\nTo show a button that loads the next page of the list, use the following syntax:\n\n    <a href=\"#\" ngm-if=\"pagerId.hasMore\" ngm-vclick=\"pagerId.loadMore()\">Load More</a>\n\n- `pagerId` is the id used in the `paged` filter.\n- `pagerId.hasMore` returns a boolean indicating if all pages of the list have been loaded.\n- `pagerId.loadMore()` loads the next page into the list.\n\nThe following example shows an example for a paged list for the data in the variable `myList`:\n\n\n    <ul data-role=\"listview\">\n        <li ng-repeat=\"item in list | paged:'pager1'\">{{item}}</li>\n        <li ngm-if=\"pager1.hasMore\">\n            <a href=\"#\" ngm-vclick=\"pager1.loadMore()\">Load more</a>\n         </li>\n    </ul>\n\nNote: `pagerId.cache` stores the last result that was returns for a `list | paged:'pagerId'` expression. This can be\n  used to check whether the paged list is empty, .. without refiltering the list.\n\nNotes on the integration of some jqm widgets\n----------------\n\n### widget collapsible\n\n- The attribute `data-collapsed` has bidirectional data binding, e.g.\n\n        <div data-role=\"collapsible\" data-collapsed=\"someProperty\">...</div>\n\n### widget checkboxradio\n\n- using `ng-repeat` with a checkbox or radio button without a wrapper element can be done like the following:\n\n        <label ng-repeat=\"l in [1,2]\">\n            {{l}}\n            <input type=\"checkbox\">\n        </label>\n\nIntegration strategy\n---------------------\n\nJquery mobile has two kinds of markup:\n\n- Stateless markup/widgets: Markup, that does not hold state or event listeners, and just adds css classes to the dom.\n  E.g. `$.fn.buttonMarkup`, which is created using `<a href=\"...\" data-role=\"button\">`\n- Stateful markup/widgets: Markup that holds state (e.g. event listeners, ...). This markup uses the jquery ui widget factory.\n  E.g. `$.mobile.button`, which is created using `<button>`.\n\nIntegration strategy:\n\n1. We have a `precompile` phase: This is called before the angular compiles does it's work, i.e. before\n   `$compile` is called, and before `directive.template` and `directive.templateUrl` is evaluated.\n   Here, we trigger the jqm `create` and `pagecreate` event.\n   Before this, we instrument all stateful jqm widgets (see above), so they do not\n   really create the jqm widget, but only add the attribute `jqm-create=<widgetName>` and `jqm-link=<widgetname>`\n   to the corresponding element. By this, all stateless  markup can be used by angular for stamping (e.g. in ng-repeat),\n   without calling a jqm method again, so we are fast.\n   Furthermore, we have special handlers in the precompile phase for those jqm widgets that wrap themselves into new elements\n   (checkboxradio, slider, button, selectmenu, search input), as the angular compiler does not like this.\n   Finally, we also mark all jqm pages with the `jqm-page` attribute. This is needed as jqm pages are\n   represented as `data-role=page` in the dom and angular does not allow to create directives that only match\n   pages but not other jqm widgets.\n\n2. We have the directive `ngmPage`:\n   This creates an own scope for every page. By this, we are able to disconnect the scope of the pages that\n   are not visible right now. This is important for optimizing performance.\n   This creates the jqm pages by calling `element.page()` in the pre link phase, however without the\n   `pagecreate` event. By this, we only create the page instance, but do not modify the dom\n   (as this is not allowed in the pre link phase). Furthermore, the `page` jqm widget instance is already\n    available for the other widgets, which are created in the post link phase.\n\n3. We have the directive `ngmCreate`:\n   This will create the jqm widgets in the post link phase. For widgets that wrap themselves into new elements this\n   needs to be called for the wrapper, that was already created in the precompile phase. This is important as\n   the jqm widgets do more DOM transformations during creations that the angular compiler does not like\n   (e.g. the jqm widget `<input type=\"checkbox>\"` enhances the sibling `<label>` element and wraps that element).\n   By calling the widget during the post link phase of the wrapper element those DOM modifications are ok with angular.\n\n4. We have the directive `ngmLink`:\n   Here we listen for changes in the model and refresh the jqm widgets when needed and vice versa.\n   For elements that wrap themselves into new elements this will be called on the original element\n   (e.g. the `<input>` for `<input type=\"checkbox\">` elements), in contrast to the `ngmCreate` directive.\n\n4. All together: This minimizes the number DOM traversals and DOM changes\n\n   * We use angular's stamping for stateless widget markup, i.e. we call the jqm functions only once,\n     and let angular do the rest.\n   * We do not use the jqm `create` event for refreshing widgets,\n     but angular's directives. By this, we prevent unneeded executions of jquery selectors.\n   * We reuse the selectors in jqm for detecting which elements should be enhanced with which jqm widgets.\n\nOhter possibilities not chosen:\n\n- Calling the jqm \"create\"-Event whenever the DOM changes (see the jqm docs). However,\n  this is very slow, as this would lead to many DOM traversals by the different jqm listeners\n  for the \"create\"-Event.\n\nIntegration of jqm routing and angular routing:\n- We chose to use the angular routing, as it is very flexible and programmable, and it is easier to integrate jqm\n  routing with angular routing and the other way around.\n",
